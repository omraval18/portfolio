In this blog post, we'll delve into the intricacies of Blackhole, a powerful yet straightforward file-sharing application built with a modern tech stack. We'll discuss the technology behind it, walk through the construction process, and even highlight some interesting code snippets that showcase the application's functionality.

## Tech Stack Breakdown

Blackhole leverages a combination of technologies to deliver a seamless and secure file-sharing experience. Here's a breakdown of its tech stack:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Blackhole uses Bulma, a popular CSS framework, to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js. Node.js provides a fast and efficient environment for building the backend, while Express.js helps create a robust API for handling file uploads, downloads, and email communications.
- **Database**: MongoDB. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides flexible storage for file metadata, including filenames, upload times, and recipient information.
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer. Nodemailer is a popular Node.js library that simplifies sending emails, crucial for notifying recipients about shared files.
- **QR Code Generation**: qrcode. This library generates QR codes that can be scanned for quick file access, enhancing convenience for users.
- **File Handling**: Multer. Multer is a powerful Node.js library that handles file uploads, providing options for managing file sizes and destinations.
- **Time Ago Formatting**: timeago.js. This library converts timestamps into user-friendly "time ago" strings, adding a touch of human readability to the file listings.

## Building Blackhole

The development of Blackhole followed a typical development workflow:

1. **Project Setup**: A new Node.js project was created with necessary packages like Express.js and MongoDB.

2. **Database Design**: A MongoDB schema was defined to store file information:

```javascript
const fileSchema = new Schema({
    filename: { type: String, required: true },
    path: { type: String, required: true },
    size: { type: Number, required: true },
    uuid: { type: String, required: true },
    sender: { type: String, required: false },
    recipients: { type: [String] },
}, { timestamps: true });

module.exports = mongoose.model('File', fileSchema);
```

3. **API Development**: The backend was built with Express.js to handle routes for file uploads, downloads, and email sending.

File Upload Route:

```javascript
router.post("/", (req, res) => {
    upload(req, res, async (err) => {
        if (!req.file) {
            return res.status(400).json({ error: "File missing" });
        }
        if (err) {
            return res.status(500).send({ error: err.message });
        }
        const file = new File({
            filename: req.file.filename,
            uuid: uuid4(),
            path: req.file.path,
            size: req.file.size,
        });
        const response = await file.save();
        // ... rest of the code to generate and send response ...
    });
});
```

Email Sending Route:

```javascript
router.post("/sendmail", async (req, res) => {
    // ... code to validate request data and fetch file from DB ... 
    const sendMail = require("../services/emailService");
    sendMail({
        from: sender,
        to: recipient,
        subject: "New Shared File",
        // ... rest of email data ...
    })
    // ... rest of the code to handle email response ...
});
```

4. **Frontend Development**: The frontend was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A simple drag-and-drop interface was implemented to enable users to easily upload files.

5. **Integration and Testing**: The frontend and backend components were integrated and thoroughly tested to ensure seamless functionality and user experience.

## Blackhole in Action

### File Sharing Process:

1. **Upload**: Users can drag-and-drop a file onto the Blackhole interface or select a file using the "Select file" button.
2. **Progress Monitoring**: A progress bar visually displays the upload progress.
3. **Download Link Generation**: Once the upload is complete, Blackhole generates a unique download link and a corresponding QR code.
4. **Sharing Options**: Users can copy the download link, which can be shared via various methods, or send the link directly to a recipient via email.
5. **Email Notification**: Blackhole sends an email notification to the recipient containing a download link and information about the shared file.
6. **File Download**: Recipients can access the file by clicking the download link in the email or scanning the QR code.

### Cleanup Functionality:

1. **Automatic Cleanup**: Files that are older than 24 hours are automatically deleted from the Blackhole storage.
2. **Manual Cleanup**: Users can manually initiate a cleanup process to delete all files older than 24 hours.

## Interesting Code Snippets

### Email Template Generation:

```javascript
module.exports = ({ sender, downloadLink, siteLink, size, expires }) => {
    return `
        <!doctype html>
        <html>
        <!-- ... rest of the email template ... -->
        <a href="${downloadLink}" target="_blank"
            style="display: inline-block; color: #ffffff; background-color: #3498db; border: solid 1px #3498db; border-radius: 5px; box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0; padding: 12px 25px; text-transform: capitalize; border-color: #3498db;">Download</a> 
        <!-- ... rest of the email template ... -->
    `;
};
```

### File Listing and Cleanup Route:

```javascript
router.get("/", async (req, res) => {
    // ... code to fetch files older than 24 hours ...
    if (oldfiles.length) {
        for (const file of oldfiles) {
            try {
                fs.unlinkSync(file.path);
                await file.remove();
                console.log(`successfully deleted ${file.filename}`);
            } catch (err) {
                console.log(`error while deleting file ${err} `);
            } finally {
                tobeDeletedFiles.push(file._id);
            }
        }
    }
    // ... code to delete files and render cleanup page ...
});
```

### User Interface Enhancements:

- **Drag-and-Drop**: The frontend utilizes JavaScript event listeners to handle drag-and-drop functionality, making file uploads intuitive.
- **Progress Bar**: The progress bar provides real-time feedback to users, enhancing the user experience and keeping them informed during file uploads.
- **QR Code Display**: QR code generation allows users to easily access shared files with a simple scan, adding convenience and reducing the need for manual copying and pasting of links.

## Conclusion

Blackhole provides a streamlined and efficient solution for sharing files. The chosen tech stack, combined with careful design and implementation, delivers a user-friendly experience with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The application's functionality, bolstered by features like automatic cleanup and QR code generation, makes file sharing both convenient and secure.
