## My Role and Responsibilities

### Development Setup

I initiated the project by setting up the development environment. This involved:

- **Constructing Client Side UI**: I designed and implemented the client-side user interface using React, which allowed for the creation of dynamic and responsive components that provided a smooth user experience.
- **Configuring Client Side Authentication**: I set up client side authentication and secured communication and verification of users and admins. 
- **Preparing Docker containers and Docker Compose for local development and testing**: I created Docker containers for the various components of the application and used Docker Compose to orchestrate these containers, simplifying the development and testing process.

### Database Design

I designed the SQL database schema to handle various user and device operations. This included:

- **User management**: I created tables and relationships to store user information and manage user roles and permissions.
- **Admin profile settings**: I designed the schema to store admin-specific settings and preferences.
- **Web admin operations**: I ensured that the database could handle the various operations performed by web admins, such as adding and removing users and managing assets.

### Authentication and Authorization

I implemented secure admin login and user management features:

- **Admin Login**: I created a special page for admin login, allowing admins to generate referral links. This involved integrating the frontend with Keycloak to handle the authentication process and generate JWT tokens.
- **Customer Onboarding**: I designed pages for admin operations and integrated them with backend APIs. This allowed admins to send referral links to new users and manage their profiles.
- **User Signup**: I developed a user management page for admins to add, remove, or change user roles. This page was integrated with the backend APIs to handle the various user management operations.

### Real-Time IoT Data Dashboard

I built a comprehensive IoT data dashboard to display:

- **Asset list and customer details**: I created components to display a list of assets and their associated customer details.
- **Asset location on Google Maps**: I integrated Google Maps to show the location of each asset, providing a visual representation of their distribution.
- **Charts for asset power, energy, revenue, and emissions**: I used charting libraries to create visualizations of various asset metrics, such as power consumption, energy usage, revenue generation, and emissions.

### Home Page and Alarms

I developed the home page to show:

- **Plant details**: I created components to display detailed information about the plant, such as its location, capacity, and status.
- **Diagrams (bar/line/notifications)**: I used charting libraries to create bar and line charts to visualize various metrics, as well as notification components to display alerts and updates.

For alarms, I created features to display:

- **Filters**: I implemented filtering options to allow users to narrow down the list of alarms based on various criteria.
- **Details of active alarms**: I created components to display detailed information about active alarms, such as their severity, status, and timestamp.
- **Today's alarms**: I implemented a feature to show a list of alarms that occurred today, providing users with a quick overview of recent issues.

### Analysis and Payment Gateway Integration

I implemented features for data analysis, including:

- **Line charts**: I used charting libraries to create line charts that visualized trends and patterns in the data.
- **Data in tabular format**: I created tables to display data in a structured format, making it easy for users to analyze and interpret the information.

Although the payment gateway integration was yet to be decided, I provided estimates for its implementation. This involved researching various payment gateway options and outlining the steps required to integrate them into the application.

### Cloud Deployment and Monitoring
