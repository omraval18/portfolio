# Lakshya 2021: A National Level Technology Festival

Lakshya 2021 was a national-level edu-technical festival held at L.D. College of Engineering in Ahmedabad, India. To showcase the event and its diverse activities, we built a dynamic and engaging website that effectively communicated the festival's theme, events, sponsors, and team.

## Project Goals

The primary goals for the Lakshya 2021 website were:

- **Clear Communication:** Present the festival's theme, "PERCEPTION," in a way that resonated with visitors.
- **Event Visibility:** Showcase the wide array of technical, non-technical, literary, and workshop events.
- **Team and Sponsor Recognition:** Highlight the individuals who made Lakshya 2021 a success and acknowledge the sponsors who supported the event.
- **Interactive User Experience:** Provide a smooth and engaging browsing experience, encouraging users to learn more about the festival.

## Technology Stack

To achieve these goals, we utilized a combination of front-end technologies:

- **React:** We chose React as the foundation for the website's user interface, leveraging its component-based structure for a modular and scalable development workflow.
- **React Router:** This library enabled us to create dynamic routing, allowing users to navigate seamlessly between different sections of the website.
- **Material-UI:** For consistent styling and pre-built components, we integrated Material-UI, making it easier to create a visually appealing and functional user interface.
- **SCSS:** Using SCSS, we implemented a structured and maintainable CSS preprocessor, enabling us to organize styles efficiently and create reusable components.
- **Axios:** To handle API requests for fetching data from the backend server, we used Axios, streamlining communication and data retrieval.
- **React-Photo-Gallery:** For showcasing the event's highlights, we integrated React-Photo-Gallery to create an image gallery that allowed users to explore images with an interactive lightbox.
- **React-Images:** We utilized React-Images to enhance the lightbox experience, providing a smooth and responsive image viewer.
- **React-Elastic-Carousel:** For displaying the team members, we chose React-Elastic-Carousel, creating a visually appealing carousel that provided a smooth browsing experience for users.
- **React-Loader-Spinner:** To provide feedback to users while data was being loaded, we included React-Loader-Spinner, improving the website's responsiveness and user experience.

## Site Design: Key Elements

The website was designed with several key elements in mind:

- **Visually Appealing Design:** A dynamic color scheme and gradient backgrounds gave the site a modern and vibrant feel, capturing the energy of the festival.
- **Responsive Layout:** The website was built using responsive design principles, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Clear Navigation:** A simple navigation menu allowed users to easily explore the different sections of the website, including information about events, the team, sponsors, and contact details.

## Technical Highlights

Some of the technical highlights of the website include:

- **Dynamic Event Data:** We implemented a system to dynamically fetch and display event data from a backend server using Axios. This allowed for easy updates and modifications to the event information.
- **Interactive Team Carousel:** The team page featured a responsive carousel that showcased team members and their roles, with transitions that enhanced the user experience.
- **Sponsors Pop-up:** When users hovered over sponsor logos, a pop-up appeared, displaying the sponsor's logo and a link to their website, providing a seamless way to learn more about the sponsors.

## Conclusion

The Lakshya 2021 website was a successful project, achieving its goals of promoting the festival and creating a memorable online presence. The combination of modern technologies and a focus on user experience helped to create a dynamic and engaging platform that effectively communicated the event's theme, activities, and spirit.
